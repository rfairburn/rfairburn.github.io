Thanks to <a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com" target="_blank" title="The Definitive Jekyll Blogging Framework">Jekyll Bootstrap</a> and <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/" target="_blank">Twitter Bootstrap</a> for making this everything to implement.

Thanks to <a href="https://www.disqus.com" target="_blank">Disqus</a> for providing a comment framework so I didn't have to make my own.
